# Architecture Decision Records

This is a location to record all high-level architecture decisions in the tendermint project.  Not the implementation details, but the reasoning that happened.  This should be refered to for guidance of the "right way" to extend the application.  And if we notice that the original decisions were lacking, we should have another open discussion, record the new decisions here, and then modify the code to match.

Read up on the concept in this [blog post](https://product.reverb.com/documenting-architecture-decisions-the-reverb-way-a3563bb24bd0#.78xhdix6t).
