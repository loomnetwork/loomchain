This is the "Basecoin" example application built on the Cosmos-SDK.  This
"Basecoin" is not affiliated with [Coinbase](http://www.getbasecoin.com/), nor
the [stable coin](http://www.getbasecoin.com/).

Assuming you've run `make get_tools && make get_vendor_deps` from the root of this repository,
run `make build` here to build the `basecoind` and `basecli` binaries.

If you want to create a new application, start by copying the Basecoin app.
